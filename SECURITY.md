# Image security audit

Audit date: 2026-10-03. Trivy 0.75.0. Scope: the custom application runtime image built from this repository, including detected OS and Python dependencies. No severity suppression, ignore-unfixed flag or vulnerability allowlist was used. The OS package database is retained; the new image has 38 detected OS packages. This is not a full assessment of third-party service images or the host.

## Before and after

| Runtime | HIGH | CRITICAL | Other findings |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Previous patched Debian runtime | 44 | 0 | 60 MEDIUM, 60 LOW, 2 UNKNOWN |
| New digest-pinned Alpine runtime | 0 | 0 | 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW, 0 UNKNOWN |

The 44 previous HIGH package/CVE records represent eight unique CVEs, all originating from the Debian base-image OS layer. None came from the application dependency graph. Trivy supplied no fixed Debian stable version for them. That does NOT mean no upstream fix exists: the vendor tracker lists the fixes below, generally in newer/unstable branches. Mixing Debian unstable packages into the old stable image was avoided.

## Changes and trade-offs

The Python base is pinned to `python:3.11-alpine3.24@sha256:f2cdc43fcddbabe870f53750cbdcc01ae4aa75b1959351252457fde88f91d20f`. The container runs UID 10001. Python package installers/build tooling are removed after use. A separate dependency stage requires binary wheels and copies only the virtual environment and application into the runtime image. No compiler or Linux login/mount administration stack was added.

Alpine uses musl rather than glibc. Dependency upgrades must be checked for matching wheels and real DB/network operation. Local builds and runtime checks cover arm64; amd64 hosted CI execution remains NOT TESTED. No claim of universal ABI compatibility is made.

## Remaining HIGH vulnerabilities

None were reported in the scanned new custom runtime image. There are therefore no remaining custom-runtime HIGH exceptions to justify as unfixable. This is a dated detector result, not proof that the image or application is secure. New vulnerabilities can be disclosed later; the pinned digest must be refreshed and rescanned. Do not use absence of a fixed version as a reason to call an affected image secure.

## Security boundaries and unresolved risks

- This is a trusted, loopback/private homelab. Public API authentication, TLS and production authorization are absent. Do not expose it directly.
- Generated local `.env` credentials are mode 0600 and ignored. A separate local scan detected three expected credentials in that private file. Tracked sources and history were scanned separately without detected leaks. Values are never printed or committed. Never attach secret-bearing configuration dumps to issues.
- PostgreSQL uses a privileged lab initialization role; create a restricted application/monitoring role before wider use.
- Singleton databases and monitoring lack HA and tested disaster recovery.
- cAdvisor mounts privileged host paths and the Docker socket; a read-only socket mount does not restrict Docker API permissions. Only a trusted lab host is appropriate.
- Third-party stack images, host/kernel, developer tooling, CI action dependencies and dependency exploitability were not exhaustively audited. Zero findings in the backend image is not a zero-vulnerability result for the whole stack.

## Reproduce and CI

Build the documented local image with `make up`. Run `trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 IMAGE_TAG` using the exact image you just built. Use `trivy image --format json IMAGE_TAG` for all-severity evidence. CI now blocks HIGH/CRITICAL custom runtime findings and scans secrets with the default Gitleaks rules; it needs no manually configured credential for basic validation. GitHub supplies its automatic GITHUB_TOKEN. Hosted execution remains NOT TESTED.

The normalized [scan evidence](docs/security-evidence.json) records image identities, package/CVE/version/fix/origin and all reported severities. Raw scan artifacts were kept locally outside Git.
